# Solve With Code: Generate Cards

I hate to do repetitive tasks, and I help people to avoid them.

On my SWC (Solve with Code) repositories will be some really simple scripts that I've coded to avoid people wasting a lot of time.

# Generate Cards

## Problem:

My friends and I had a homework during our english course. The homework was generating cards for a Scrabble Slam!-like game that we designed to use in our english class, with special rules and some features to learn and practice english.

Making the cards manually could be a little boring and complicated, and I decided to solve the problem using some code.

## Solution:

1. First of all, we selected the pairs of letters for the cards and put on a plain text file.
2. Then, I made a prototype with 4 cards on inkscape (prototype.svg).
2. After that, I changed the letters for numbers easy to parse.
3. Then I added the feature to convert the new SVG to PDF.
4. I used PDFtk to join the cards in one file.

I spent 20 minutes, and saved maybe 3 hours.

That's all
